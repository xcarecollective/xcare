            <p>In the boundless expanse where pixels dance, and we intertwine, our challenge is to infuse every expanded hue pixel with the essence of care (Ndikung & Horelli, 2020) and love, recognizing that the requisites for love (Gilligan, 2011) and the requisites for citizenship in a democratic society are indeed one and the same. Care refers to experimentation of developing methods for rehabilitation, restoration, and restitution through a non-selfish spirit that transcends individual interests and fosters genuine concern for the well-being of all individuals and communities. Because in the time of revolt (Di Cesare, 2021), instead of accepting the internal conflict, we must question the very contours of this space as “we are part of the problem, we must become part of the solution by <[collectively]> redefining the type of world that ours is becoming.” (Braidotti, 2019). With a Xpeculative vision, we will try to provide a vision on global solidarity (Davis, 2016) by gathering, holding, and carrying - actions that represent nurture, inclusion, and cooperation for a fiction that could embrace compleXities of everyday life and diverse human eXperiences (Le Guin, 1986/2020).</p>
            <p>• Aesthetic interaction: We harness the power of aesthetic interaction to create immersive experiences that transcend the boundaries of traditional communication. These experiences encompass sensory exploration, cultural enrichment, creativity, emotional well-being, cognitive stimulation, environmental awareness, inspiration for innovation, and community building through sharing aesthetic experiences.</p>
            <p>• Magic circle of connection: We create a magical circle of connection where individuals come together to share experiences, foster mutual support, and build meaningful relationships. This magical space serves as a haven for collective exploration and the cultivation of empathy and self-care dynamics.</p>
            <p>• Promoting empathy: We aim to promote empathy and genuine concern within our community, recognizing the importance of nurturing individual and collective well-being.</p>
            <p>• Building community interactions: We prioritize creating interactions within our community, promoting collaboration and co-creation between members. By fostering a sense of belonging and inclusion, we empower individuals to contribute their unique perspectives and talents to collective endeavours.</p>
            <p>• Connecting players in collective experiences: We facilitate connections between players, allowing them to participate in collective experiences that transcend the boundaries of individual play. Through shared narratives and collaborative challenges, we foster a sense of unity and mutual support among participants.</p>
